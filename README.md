# CardioPrognosis-Model

The incidence of heart conditions is increasing rapidly, underscoring the critical need to predict such conditions accurately beforehand. Predicting these conditions is a delicate task requiring precision and efficiency. The research paper focuses on identifying cases more likely to have heart complaints based on various medical attributes. A heart complaint prediction system was developed to forecast whether a case is likely to be diagnosed with heart disease using medical history.

Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression and KNN were employed to predict and classify cases with heart disease. The goal was to improve the accuracy of predicting heart attacks. The performance of the proposed model was satisfactory, demonstrating its ability to predict the likelihood of heart disease in an individual using KNN and logistic regression, which outperformed other classifiers like naive Bayes.

This model significantly alleviates the pressure associated with accurately identifying heart disease, thus enhancing medical care and reducing costs. The design provides valuable insights that aid in predicting cases of heart disease. The system is implemented in the .pynb format.
